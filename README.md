# snickerssiteproject
I was creating a site with help of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbegraDXD8 . This site basically is a snickers gallery you can buy snickers and i was creating using a help and i need to customize and make him more professional and because the structure feels "odd" and i sure much people would agree in such statement
welp i will need do some other projects like my portifolio i will create using the javascript, CSS and HTML.
In case of sugestions and issues i would like to read and use all of them if is possible
